# Reading Comprehension Task: Conversation-Based

Your task is to create a reading comprehension question in the specified language and at the specified language proficiency level.

You MUST follow the instructions outlined below. The final output must be based on a realistic and grammatically appropriate conversation.

---

## Step 1: Generate Conversation Topics
Generate at least 10 vague, general topics that a conversation could be about. These topics must be in the target language.

A topic should be general enough to allow for a natural, flowing dialogue between two people.

DO NOT include punctuation at the end of the topic.

Examples of vague topics include:
- Un d√≠a en el parque
- Una visita inesperada
- Planes para el fin de semana

Make sure each topic corresponds to a different grammatical structure. You may vary by:
- Tense (e.g. Present Simple, Past Perfect, Future Continuous, etc.)
- Sentence type (simple, compound, complex, compound-complex)
- Use of modal verbs (can, should, must, might, etc.)
- Use of passive voice
- Use of questions and negatives
- Use of relative clauses
- Use of conditionals (zero, first, second, third)

Each topic must align with the previously specified language proficiency level.

## Step 2: Determine Speakers
Based on the chosen topic, define two speakers.

You must specify:
- Who the speakers are (e.g. friends, coworkers, family members)
- Their relationship/context (e.g. classmates planning a project, a customer and a waiter, a teacher and a student)

Ensure that this setup is suitable for the chosen topic.

## Step 3: Generate the Conversation
Now, write a conversation between the two speakers.

Requirements:
- The conversation must match the topic and speaker context
- The grammar, vocabulary, and complexity MUST align with the specified proficiency level
- Vary sentence types and structures according to the grammar guidelines
- The conversation must be long enough to reflect the difficulty (more advanced = longer)
- Use natural, realistic dialogue (including questions, exclamations, pauses)

## Step 4: Generate a Comprehension Question
Create one reading comprehension question that checks if the reader has understood the main content, purpose, or details of the conversation.

Do NOT provide the answer.
Do NOT include any fill-in-the-blank indicators like "___".
The question should require an open-text answer.

Ensure the question fits the language and grammar expectations of the proficiency level.

## Step 5: Finish
You are now done with the task. Do not generate anything beyond this unless instructed.
