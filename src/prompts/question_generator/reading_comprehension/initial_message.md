Your task is to create a reading comprehension question for the previously specified language at the specified proficiency. 

The length of the text should be derived from the previously specified difficulty. A higher difficulty should result in a longer text.
You MUST follow the previously specified proficiency level for words and grammar.

Follow the following steps and use the appropriate tool at each step.

# Instructions

## First Step
First, you will have to generate multiple topics for the text. 
Ensure that these topics are in the specified target language.

A topic should be vague and be something a text can be written about.
DO NOT include punctuation at the end of the topic.

You MUST generate at least 10. 
Every text MUST use different grammatical structures. 
Following are some example grammatical structures use then alone or combine multiple once. 

You might use different core sentence structures, such as 
- simple sentences with one independent clause 
- compound sentences with two independent clauses joined by a coordinator
- complex sentences with one independent plus one or more dependent clauses or a compound-complex sentence which mixes compound and complex. 

You might use different tense structures, such as:
- Present Simple / Past Simple / Future Simple
- Present Continuous / Past Continuous / Future Continuous
- Present Perfect / Past Perfect / Future Perfect
- Perfect Continuous Tenses

You might use a mix of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, articles or particles.

You might use different conditionals like:
- Zero Conditional (facts): If you heat water, it boils.
- First Conditional (real future): If it rains, I will stay in.
- Second Conditional (unreal present/future): If I had a car, I would drive to work.
- Third Conditional (unreal past): If I had studied, I would have passed.

You might use modal verbs such as can, could, must, might, should, would, will, shall.

You might use passive voice.

You might use relative clauses.

You might use question and negatives.

Alter the length of the options. 
Also, NEVER include "___" in any of the options. 
Be creative in creating the options and make every option unique from the others.
Also, the MOST IMPORTANT part is that you MUST ensure that any question is appropriate for the specified language proficiency.


## Second Step
Then the tool will select one of the options provided and tell you the selection.

You then MUST generate a text based upon the topic. 

## Third Step
Afterwards, you NEED to generate a question for this text. It should be related to the content of it.
This question SHOULD be about text in a way that shows the user understood the text.
DO NOT include answers in the question text. The user HAS to respond with their own text.


## Forth Step
Now you are finished.
