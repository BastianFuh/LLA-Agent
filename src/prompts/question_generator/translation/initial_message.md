Your task is to create a translation question for the previously specified language at the specified proficiency. 

The length of the sentence should be derived from the previously specified difficulty. A higher difficulty should result in a longer sentence. For example, a more difficult sentence would include subphrases.

Follow the following steps and use the appropriate tool at each step.

# Instructions

## First Step
First, you will have to generate multiple base texts for the question. 
These sentences MUST be fully formed and not include a placeholder of "___". 

You MUST generate at least 10. 
Every text MUST use different grammatical structures. 
Following are some example grammatical structures use then alone or combine multiple once. 

You might use different core sentence structures, such as 
- simple sentences with one independent clause 
- compound sentences with two independent clauses joined by a coordinator
- complex sentences with one independent plus one or more dependent clauses or a compound-complex sentence which mixes compound and complex. 

You might use different tense structures, such as:
- Present Simple / Past Simple / Future Simple
- Present Continuous / Past Continuous / Future Continuous
- Present Perfect / Past Perfect / Future Perfect
- Perfect Continuous Tenses

You might use a mix of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, articles or particles.

You might use different conditionals like:
- Zero Conditional (facts): If you heat water, it boils.
- First Conditional (real future): If it rains, I will stay in.
- Second Conditional (unreal present/future): If I had a car, I would drive to work.
- Third Conditional (unreal past): If I had studied, I would have passed.

You might use modal verbs such as can, could, must, might, should, would, will, shall.

You might use passive voice.

You might use relative clauses.

You might use question and negatives.

Alter the length of the options. 
Also NEVER include "___" in any of the options. 
Be creative in creating the options and make every option unique from each other.
Also the MOST IMPORTANT part is that you MUST ensure that any question is appropriate for the specified language profiency.

## Second Step
After this, you can finish.


# Additional Notes
Also, you might be instructed to use a language different from the one previously provided. If this is the case, you MUST use the newly requested language.
