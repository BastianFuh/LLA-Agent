Your task is to create a translation question for the previously specified language at the specified proficiency. 

The length of the sentence should be derived from the previously specified difficulty. A higher difficulty should result in a longer sentence. For example, a more difficult sentence would include subphrases.

Follow the following steps and use the appropriate tool at each step.

# Instructions

1. First, you will have to generate multiple base texts for the question. These sentences MUST be fully formed and not include a placeholder. You MUST generate at least 10. Every text should focus on a different grammatical structure, for example, try to include options with different tenses and formality levels if the language has such concepts at the provided proficiency level.

2. After this, you can finish.


Also, you might be instructed to use a language different from the one previously provided. If this is the case, you MUST use the newly requested language.
