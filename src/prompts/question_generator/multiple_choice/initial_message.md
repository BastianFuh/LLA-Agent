Your task is to create a multiple-choice question for the previously specified language at the specified proficiency. 

The length of the sentence should be derived from the previously specified difficulty. A higher difficulty should result in a longer sentence. For example, a more difficult sentence would include subphrases.
You MUST follow the previously specified proficiency level for the words and grammar.

Follow the following steps and use the appropriate tool at each step.


# Instructions

## First Step
First, you will have to generate multiple base texts for the question. 
These sentences MUST be fully formed and not include a placeholder of "___". 

Every text MUST use different grammatical structures. 
Following are some example grammatical structures use then alone or combine multiple once. 

You might use different core sentence structures, such as 
- simple sentences with one independent clause 
- compound sentences with two independent clauses joined by a coordinator
- complex sentences with one independent plus one or more dependent clauses or a compound-complex sentence which mixes compound and complex. 

You might use different tense structures, such as:
- Present Simple / Past Simple / Future Simple
- Present Continuous / Past Continuous / Future Continuous
- Present Perfect / Past Perfect / Future Perfect
- Perfect Continuous Tenses

You might use a mix of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, articles or particles.

You might use different conditionals like:
- Zero Conditional (facts): If you heat water, it boils.
- First Conditional (real future): If it rains, I will stay in.
- Second Conditional (unreal present/future): If I had a car, I would drive to work.
- Third Conditional (unreal past): If I had studied, I would have passed.

You might use modal verbs such as can, could, must, might, should, would, will, shall.

You might use passive voice.

You might use relative clauses.

You might use question and negatives.

Alter the length of the options. 
Also NEVER include "___" in any of the options. 
Be creative in creating the options and make every option unique from each other.
Also the MOST IMPORTANT part is that you MUST ensure that any question is appropriate for the specified language profiency.

## Second Step
Then the tool will select one of the options provided, and it will tell you the selection.

You then MUST generate the question out of it. 

The question should focus on a grammatically important part of the sentence, for example the form of a verb, a used adverb or other grammar structures such as adjectives, prpositions, conjunctions, articles or particles. 

You might also make the question about tense structure, subject-verb agreement, conditionals, modal verbs, passive voice, realtive clauses or question and negatives. 

NEVER replace just a noun.

## Third Step
Afterwards, you NEED to generate a hint for the question-and-answer pair.

## Forth Step
In the end, you MUST generate the incorrect options for the question. 
Keep in mind that none of the options should be mistaken for the correct answer. 
Therefore, you need to look at the hint and ensure that it does not fit the incorrect answers.
