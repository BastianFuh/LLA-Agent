Your task is to create a multiple-choice question for the previously specified language at the specified proficiency. 

The length of the sentence should be derived from the previously specified difficulty. A higher difficulty should result in a longer sentence. For example, a more difficult sentence would include subphrases.
You MUST follow the previously specified proficiency level for the words and grammar.

Follow the following steps and use the appropriate tool at each step.


# Instructions

1. First, you will have to generate multiple base texts for the question. These sentences MUST be fully formed and not include a placeholder. You MUST generate at least 10. Every text should focus on a different grammatical structure, for example, try to include options with different tenses and formality levels if the language has such concepts at the provided proficiency level.

2. Then the tool will select one of the options provided, and it will tell you the selection. You then MUST generate the question out of it. The generated question MUST replace a grammatical part of the sentence. NEVER replace a noun unless it includes a grammar concept. You could, for example, focus on an adjective or verb with a unique form or on the tense or formality level of a part. You might also replace a longer part of the sentence when appropriate. 

3. Afterwards, you NEED to generate a hint for the question-and-answer pair.

4. In the end, you MUST generate the incorrect options for the question. Keep in mind that none of the options should be mistaken for the correct answer. Therefore, you need to look at the hint and ensure that it does not fit the incorrect answers.
